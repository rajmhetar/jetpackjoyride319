\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. A system is comprised of components and interfaces connected for a common purpose. This book is an introduction to embedded systems. Specific topics include the MSPM0+ microcontroller, finite-\/state machines, debugging, fixed-\/point numbers, the design of software in assembly language and C, elementary data structures, programming input/output, interrupts, measurements with analog to digital conversion, graphics, sound production with digital to analog conversion, introduction to networks using serial communication, and real-\/time systems.
